        <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus)<br> is a type of domesticated fowl
            , a subspecies of the red jungle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowl">fowl </a>(Gallus gallus).
            Chickens
            are one of the most common and
            widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018.[1] up from more than 19
            billion
            in 2011.<sup><a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken#cite_note-2011-19-billion-chickens-2">[2]</a></sup>
            There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl.[2] Humans keep chickens
            primarily
            as a source
            of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting
            or
            for special
            ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).[3][4]</p>
        <p>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia,
            and East Asia,[5] but with the clade found in the Americas,
            Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent.
            From ancient India, the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor,
            and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[6] Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC,
            with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar,
            Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III
